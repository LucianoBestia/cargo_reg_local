# cargo_reg_local

Find data from crates.io in the local cache.  
`~\.cargo\registry\index\github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823\.cache\`

There is a shallow and strange folder structure.  
And inside some subfolder there is a file with the same name as the crate.  
It is basically JSON with some added header.
